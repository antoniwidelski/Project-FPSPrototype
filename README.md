# Project FPSPrototype
 First Person Hero Shooter Prototype

This project is Hero FPS,  where player character is inspired by games like Overwatch or Paladins.

It is made in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and engine tools: blueprints, animation blueprints and state machines, behovior trees.

It shows my abilities to design and implement game mechanics.
It is designed to have properties (like health, damage etc.) which can be easily edit by game designers.

Project is not pure prototype, but is more like mini game. There are user friendly elements like menu, UI, sounds, graphic that are important elements for overall enjoyment of the game (sounds, enemies' models and explosions aren't created by me).

Thank to object oriented structure of project new character or enemy classes can be added without changing previously written code.

Video of gameplay is available on YouTube:
